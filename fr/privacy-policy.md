## 1. Information We Collect

We collect minimal personal data and only what is necessary to provide the core functionality of the app.

### a. Location Data

- We request access to your device’s location to fetch local weather data using Apple’s **WeatherKit**.
- **We do not store or transmit your location to our servers**. Location data is passed directly to Apple’s WeatherKit API.
- You can control location permissions at any time through your device settings.

### b. Analytics & Crash Reporting (via Firebase)

We use **Firebase**, a service provided by Google, to collect anonymized analytics and crash reports. This helps us understand app usage and improve performance.

Firebase may collect:
- Device and app information (e.g., model, OS version, crashes)
- General usage patterns and event metrics (no personally identifiable information)
- IP address (used temporarily for analytics purposes)

You can learn more about Firebase’s data practices here:
